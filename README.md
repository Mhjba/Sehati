## Introduction:

"Sehati" website is a web project focusing on health-related topics, providing tips and information for maintaining health. The homepage includes the project title and links to navigate to internal pages or additional content.
Internal pages also contain information and articles on various health topics. They also feature interactive elements such as communicating with the team for information or contacting helpline numbers.


## The Story:

When I started developing the "Sehati" website project, my vision was clear to create a platform that combines technology and health to help individuals improve their health lifestyles. My inspiration stemmed from the desire to provide something that assists people in living healthier and happier lives.
As a developer, this experience was educational in itself, learning a lot about analyzing user needs and designing effective user interfaces. The journey has been full of challenges and triumphs, but the passion for delivering a meaningful product and achieving goals has been my primary driving force.
With every success and failure, I realized the importance of humanity in technology, and how technical projects can deeply touch people's lives. Therefore, I always try to infuse emotions and spirit into my work, which makes me look forward to collaborating with individuals who appreciate this human and creative aspect in technical projects.

## Source of inspiration:

I developed the "Sehati" project based on my personal experience in the field of health. I was looking for a way to combine my passion for software development with my interest in personal wellness.

## The technical challenge:

One of the biggest technical challenges I faced in the "Sehati" project was designing and implementing a user interface that allows users to access information and tools easily and efficiently. The design and development process took a long time to ensure a satisfactory user experience.
